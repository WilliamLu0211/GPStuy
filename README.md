Where's Room 251?

Nah
SUN 10:05 PM
some things that just popped into my head that we should note:
we should first allow the user to select parent, visitor, or student and work on the visitor one first, which will let you go to one classroom at a time rather than inputting an entire schedule. this lets us build up from being able to just path from one place to another before tackling chaining. the parent function would sync up with their kid's schedule so you know where yo go for ptc and such.
we sjhould also accoutn for a and b days for student scheds
maybe even implement rhe mr brooks schedule thing into ours
bruh wtf the proposal is due wednesday
every user should have the possibility for inputting any destination and starting point
we dont have to restrict that to type of user
@Ivan Zhang

LMFAO
the order is like
figure out starting pt to destination
scheduiles
freinds
hmmm about the mr. brooks scheduler thing, we could probably implement it such that it would tell u what class u have now and how to path there from ur current loc/prev classroom and also give the option to view your entire schedule pathing on any given day
ya sounds right
can we like send a request to his thing for the time and period
i think implementing pathing to local restaurants is good to do right after pt to destination
and we can call apis for that
nah he doesnt have an api for it
but i can make an api to do that
it's very easy
